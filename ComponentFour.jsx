            Kabir Singh is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Sandeep Reddy 
            Vanga and jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under T-Series Films and Murad Khetani and 
            Ashwin Varde under Cine1 Studios. A remake of Vanga's own debut Telugu film Arjun Reddy (2017), 
            it stars Shahid Kapoor in the titular role as a surgeon who spirals into self-destruction when his girlfriend,
            Preeti, played by Kiara Advani, marries someone else. Adil Hussain, Nikita Dutta, Arjan Bajwa, Suresh Oberoi,
            Dolly Minhas, Suparna Marwah, Anurag Arora, Soham Majumdar, Kunal Thakur, Anusha Sampath, 
            Amit Sharma and Kamini Kaushal feature in supporting roles.

            Principal photography for Kabir Singh began in October 2018 and ended in March 2019.
            The film was theatrically released in India on 21 June 2019 and received mixed reviews with criticism 
            directed at it glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity, though Kapoor's 
            performance and the soundtrack were praised. Grossing over â‚¹380 crore,
            it became the second highest grossing Bollywood film of 2019,[4]
            and Kapoor's highest grossing solo-lead release.
