            Padmaavat is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language epic period drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. 
            Based on the epic poem of the same name by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, it stars Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen known for her beauty, wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh, played by Shahid Kapoor. Sultan Alauddin Khilji, played by Ranveer Singh, hears of her beauty and attacks her kingdom to enslave her. Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Raza Murad, and Anupriya Goenka featured in supporting roles.[1][10]

            With a production budget of ₹215 crore (US$30 million), 
            Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.
            Initially scheduled for release on 1 December 2017, 
            Padmaavat faced numerous controversies. Amid violent protests,
            its release was indefinitely delayed.
            In December, the Central Board of Film Certification approved the film with few changes,
            which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and a change from its original title Padmavati.
            Padmaavat was rescheduled for release on 25 January 2018 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D formats,
           making it the first Indian film to be released in IMAX 3D.[16]

           Padmaavat received mixed reviews. Critics praised the visuals, 
           the cinematography and Singh's portrayal of evil Khilji, 
           but criticised its storyline, execution, length and adherence to regressive patriarchal mores.
           Critics also disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king which led to protests by religious communities.
           Despite not being released in some states of India, it grossed over ₹585 crore (US$82 million) at the box office,
           becoming a commercial success and the 10th highest-grossing Indian film of all time.[25][26] At 64th Filmfare Awards,
           Padmaavat received a leading 18 nominations, and won four awards, including Best Actor (Critics) for Singh.
           It also won three National Film Awards, including Best Music Direction for Bhansali.
